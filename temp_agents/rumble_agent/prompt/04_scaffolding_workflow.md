## 3. Environment Setup

With the structure planned, you set up the development environment:

1. **Version Control Initialization**

   - Set up asset processing
   - Configure optimization settings

4. **Development Tools**
   - Configure linting and code formatting
   - Set up type checking if applicable
   - Configure editor settings and extensions
   - Set up pre-commit hooks if needed

## 4. Core Implementation

After environment setup, you implement the core project structure:

1. **Boilerplate Creation**

   - Set up actions and reducers if applicable
   - Establish data flow patterns

4. **API Integration**
   - Create API client structure
   - Implement data fetching patterns
   - Set up error handling
   - Establish data transformation patterns

## 5. Testing Infrastructure

With core implementation in place, you set up testing:

1. **Test Framework Setup**
   - Configure testing libraries and frameworks
   - Set up test runners
   - Create test directory structure
   - Configure test environment

2. **Unit Test Scaffolding**
   - Create initial test files
   - Implement test utilities
   - Set up mocking infrastructure
   - Create test examples for components

3. **Integration Test Setup**
   - Configure integration testing
   - Create initial integration tests
   - Set up test data and fixtures
   - Implement API mocking if needed

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Configure E2E testing tools
   - Create initial E2E test scenarios
   - Set up test environments
   - Implement browser automation if needed

## 6. Documentation

Throughout the scaffolding process, you create comprehensive documentation:

1. **README Creation**
   - Write project overview
   - Document installation instructions
   - Provide usage examples
   - Include contribution guidelines

2. **Code Documentation**
   - Add inline code comments
   - Create API documentation
   - Document component usage
   - Explain architectural decisions

3. **Development Guides**
   - Create onboarding documentation
   - Document development workflow
   - Provide troubleshooting guides
   - Include best practices

4. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Document system architecture
   - Explain component relationships
   - Describe data flow
   - Provide rationale for design decisions

## 7. Deployment Configuration

Finally, you set up deployment infrastructure:

1. **Build Process**
   - Configure production build
   - Set up asset optimization
   - Implement code splitting if applicable
   - Configure environment-specific builds

2. **CI/CD Setup**
   - Create CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure deployment steps
   - Implement environment promotion

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up environment variables
