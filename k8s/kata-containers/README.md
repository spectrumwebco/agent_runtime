# Kata Containers Configuration

This directory contains the configuration for Kata Containers, a secure container runtime that provides VM-like isolation.

## Features

- **VM-level Isolation**: Each sandbox runs in its own lightweight VM
- **OCI Compatibility**: Compatible with OCI container standards
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized for performance and resource usage
- **Security**: Hardware-enforced isolation between containers

## Components

1. **RuntimeClass**: Defines the Kata Containers runtime class for Kubernetes
2. **DaemonSet**: Deploys the Kata Containers runtime on worker nodes
3. **Sandbox**: Defines the sandbox environment for the Agent Runtime

## Usage

To deploy Kata Containers:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
kubectl apply -f sandbox.yaml
```

## Integration with Agent Runtime

Kata Containers provides secure sandbox environments for the Agent Runtime, allowing:

1. Isolated execution of untrusted code
2. Secure multi-tenant deployments
3. Hardware-enforced security boundaries
