- No built-in load balancing
- Basic RPC implementation
- No event-driven architecture
- Limited resilience features

### 2. Enhancement Opportunities
- **Service Architecture**: Implement a robust microservices architecture
- **Service Discovery**: Add automatic service registration and discovery
- **Load Balancing**: Implement client-side load balancing
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Add support for event-driven communication
- **Resilience**: Implement retries, circuit breaking, and rate limiting
- **Authentication**: Enhance authentication with service identity

### 3. Integration Points
- **Server Initialization**: Enhance server initialization with Go Micro
- **Service Registration**: Implement service registration with Go Micro
- **Client Communication**: Use Go Micro for client-side communication
- **Event Publishing**: Implement event publishing with Go Micro
- **Event Subscription**: Implement event subscription with Go Micro
- **Authentication**: Integrate Go Micro's authentication system

### 4. Benefits to Kled.io Framework
- **Scalability**: Improved scalability with microservices architecture
- **Reliability**: Enhanced reliability with resilience features
- **Maintainability**: Better organized code with service boundaries
- **Extensibility**: Easier to add new services
- **Performance**: Improved performance with load balancing

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Components
- **Service Registry**: Central registry for service discovery
- **Service Client**: Client for service communication
- **Service Server**: Server for handling requests
- **Event Broker**: Broker for event-driven communication
- **Auth Service**: Service for authentication and authorization

### 2. API Design
- **Service API**: Standard API for service communication
- **Event API**: Standard API for event-driven communication
- **Auth API**: Standard API for authentication and authorization
- **Config API**: Standard API for configuration management
- **Store API**: Standard API for data storage

### 3. User Experience
