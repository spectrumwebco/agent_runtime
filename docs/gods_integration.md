# GoDS Data Structures Integration

This document describes the integration of [GoDS](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods) (Go Data Structures) into the Kled.io Framework.

## Overview

GoDS is a comprehensive library that provides implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Go. This integration enables the Kled.io Framework to leverage efficient and well-tested data structures for a wide range of applications, enhancing the framework's capabilities for data manipulation and algorithm implementation.

## Directory Structure

The integration follows the established pattern for the agent_runtime repository:

```
agent_runtime/
├── cmd/cli/commands/
│   └── gods.go                # CLI commands for GoDS
├── internal/datastructures/gods/
│   └── client.go              # Client wrapper for GoDS
└── pkg/modules/gods/
    └── module.go              # Module integration for the framework
```

## Features

The GoDS integration provides the following capabilities:

1. **Lists**
   - ArrayList: Dynamic array implementation
   - SinglyLinkedList: Linked list with single links
   - DoublyLinkedList: Linked list with double links

2. **Maps**
   - HashMap: Hash table implementation
   - TreeMap: Red-black tree implementation
   - LinkedHashMap: Preserves insertion order
   - HashBidiMap: Bidirectional map with hash tables
   - TreeBidiMap: Bidirectional map with red-black tree

3. **Sets**
   - HashSet: Hash table implementation
   - TreeSet: Red-black tree implementation
   - LinkedHashSet: Preserves insertion order

4. **Stacks**
   - ArrayStack: Dynamic array implementation
   - LinkedListStack: Linked list implementation

5. **Queues**
   - ArrayQueue: Dynamic array implementation
   - LinkedListQueue: Linked list implementation
   - CircularBuffer: Fixed size circular buffer
   - PriorityQueue: Elements ordered by priority

6. **Trees**
   - RedBlackTree: Self-balancing binary search tree
   - AVLTree: Height-balanced binary search tree
   - BTree: Self-balancing tree data structure
   - BinaryHeap: Tree-based data structure with heap property

## Integration with Multiple Container Runtimes

This integration is designed to work with Spectrum Web Co's infrastructure that supports multiple container runtimes including LXC, Podman, Docker, and Kata Containers. The data structures can be used in any of these container environments, providing consistent behavior across different deployment scenarios.

## CLI Commands

The GoDS integration provides the following CLI commands:

```bash
# List available data structures
kled gods list

# Get information about a specific data structure
kled gods info arraylist

# Run a simple example
kled gods example

# Create and manipulate a specific data structure
kled gods create --type list --structure arraylist
kled gods create --type map --structure hashmap
kled gods create --type set --structure hashset
kled gods create --type stack --structure arraystack
kled gods create --type queue --structure priorityqueue
```

## Integration with Other Framework Components

The GoDS integration works seamlessly with other components of the Kled.io Framework:

1. **LangChain Integration**: Use data structures for efficient data processing in LLM workflows
2. **LeetCode Solver**: Leverage optimized data structures for algorithm implementations
3. **Microservices**: Use data structures for efficient data handling in distributed systems
4. **Web Framework**: Implement caching and data management with efficient data structures

## Use Cases

The GoDS integration enables various use cases within the Kled.io Framework:

1. **Efficient Data Management**: Use optimized data structures for storing and retrieving data
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement complex algorithms using appropriate data structures
3. **Performance Optimization**: Replace inefficient data structures with more appropriate ones
4. **Memory Management**: Use memory-efficient data structures for large datasets
5. **Specialized Operations**: Leverage specialized data structures for specific operations

## Dependencies

## Future Enhancements

1. Add support for custom comparators and iterators
2. Implement additional data structures (e.g., Trie, Graph)
3. Create specialized data structures for specific use cases
4. Add benchmarking tools for comparing data structure performance
5. Implement persistence mechanisms for data structures
