## Integration Approach

Each repository is integrated following these principles:

1. **Deep Integration**: Not just surface-level wrappers but full functionality integration
2. **Framework Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with existing Kled.io Framework
3. **User Accessibility**: Making functionality easily accessible through CLI and API
4. **Architectural Consistency**: Following established patterns in the agent_runtime codebase
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Providing clear usage examples and integration details

## Next Steps

1. Continue integration of remaining repositories
2. Enhance cross-repository integration for seamless interoperability
3. Develop comprehensive examples demonstrating combined usage
4. Create unified documentation for the entire Kled.io Framework
