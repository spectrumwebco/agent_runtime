# Agent Runtime Architecture

## Overview

Agent Runtime is a high-performance Go-based backend framework for building autonomous software engineering agents. It leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a powerful, extensible system that can integrate with various LLMs and tools.

This document describes the architecture of the Agent Runtime framework, including its core components, interfaces, and execution flow.

## Core Components

### Agent Loop

The Agent Loop is the central component of the framework, responsible for managing the agent's execution cycle. It follows a state-based execution model with the following phases:

1. **task_initiation**: Initializes state tracking across multiple responsibility layers
2. **analyze_requirements**: Evaluates task requirements and determines appropriate toolchain
3. **tool_discovery**: Dynamically discovers appropriate tools based on context
4. **planning_phase**: Develops multi-step execution plan with tasks and dependencies
5. **execution_phase**: Executes each step while maintaining state
6. **tool_transition_evaluation**: Determines if transitioning between toolchain tiers is required
7. **toolbelt_activation**: Activates specialized tools when standard toolchain is insufficient
8. **completion_verification**: Confirms all objectives have been accomplished
9. **state_cleanup**: Removes completed states from storage

The Agent Loop maintains a state object that tracks the current phase, task, events, and context. It also provides methods for adding events and transitioning between phases.

### Modules

Modules are pluggable components that extend the functionality of the Agent Runtime. Each module implements the `Module` interface, which defines methods for initialization, cleanup, and tool access.

The framework includes several built-in modules:

- **Planning Module**: Responsible for task planning and execution tracking
- **Knowledge Module**: Provides access to best practices and reference information
- **Datasource Module**: Enables access to authoritative data sources

Modules can be registered with the Module Registry, which manages their lifecycle and provides access to them.

### Tools

Tools are the primary means by which the agent interacts with the environment. Each tool implements the `Tool` interface, which defines methods for execution and metadata access.

The framework includes several built-in tools:

- **Shell Tool**: Executes shell commands
- **File Tool**: Performs file operations
- **HTTP Tool**: Makes HTTP requests
- **Git Tool**: Performs Git operations
- **Python Tool**: Executes Python code
- **Docker Tool**: Manages Docker containers
- **Kubernetes Tool**: Manages Kubernetes resources

Tools are registered with the Tool Registry, which manages their lifecycle and provides access to them.

### MCP Servers

MCP Servers implement the Model Context Protocol, enabling communication between the agent and external tools. Each server provides a set of resources and tools that can be accessed through the protocol.

The framework includes several built-in MCP servers:

- **Filesystem Server**: Provides access to the filesystem
- **Tools Server**: Provides access to registered tools
- **Runtime Server**: Manages the runtime environment

MCP Servers are managed by the MCP Manager, which handles their lifecycle and provides access to them.

### Python Integration

The Python Integration component enables the agent to execute Python code and interact with Python libraries. It provides a bridge between Go and Python, allowing the agent to leverage existing Python tools and libraries.

The Python Integration includes:

- **Interpreter**: Manages the Python interpreter
- **FFI**: Provides foreign function interface for calling Python from Go
- **Package Management**: Handles Python package installation and management

## Interfaces

### Module Interface

```go
type Module interface {
	// Name returns the name of the module
	Name() string
	
	// Description returns the description of the module
	Description() string
	
	// Tools returns the tools provided by the module
	Tools() []tools.Tool
	
	// Initialize initializes the module with the given context
	Initialize(ctx context.Context) error
	
	// Cleanup cleans up the module resources
	Cleanup() error
}
```

### Tool Interface

```go
type Tool interface {
	// Name returns the name of the tool
	Name() string
	
	// Description returns the description of the tool
	Description() string
	
	// Execute executes the tool with the given arguments
	Execute(ctx context.Context, args map[string]interface{}) (interface{}, error)
}
```

### MCP Server Interface

```go
type MCPServer interface {
	// Start starts the MCP server
	Start() error
	
	// Stop stops the MCP server
	Stop() error
	
	// AddTool adds a tool to the MCP server
	AddTool(tool mcp.Tool, handler mcp.ToolHandler) error
	
	// AddResource adds a resource to the MCP server
	AddResource(resource mcp.Resource, handler mcp.ResourceHandler) error
	
	// AddPrompt adds a prompt to the MCP server
	AddPrompt(prompt mcp.Prompt, handler mcp.PromptHandler) error
}
```

## Execution Flow

1. The user submits a task to the Agent Runtime server.
2. The server creates a new Agent instance and starts the Agent Loop.
3. The Agent Loop initializes the state and transitions to the `task_initiation` phase.
4. The Agent Loop executes each phase in sequence, transitioning between phases based on the results.
5. During the `tool_discovery` phase, the Agent Loop identifies the tools needed for the task.
6. During the `planning_phase`, the Agent Loop creates a plan for executing the task.
7. During the `execution_phase`, the Agent Loop executes the plan, using tools and modules as needed.
8. If specialized tools are needed, the Agent Loop transitions to the `toolbelt_activation` phase.
9. Once the task is complete, the Agent Loop transitions to the `completion_verification` phase.
10. Finally, the Agent Loop transitions to the `state_cleanup` phase and then to `idle`.
11. The server returns the results to the user.

## Error Handling

The Agent Loop includes robust error handling capabilities. When an error occurs during execution, the Agent Loop transitions to the `error_handling` phase, where it attempts to recover from the error.

Error handling strategies include:

1. **Retry**: Retry the failed operation with the same parameters.
2. **Alternative Approach**: Try an alternative approach to accomplish the same goal.
3. **Fallback**: Use a fallback strategy if the primary approach fails.
4. **Abort**: Abort the task if recovery is not possible.

## Deployment

Agent Runtime is designed to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster using kata containers. This provides a secure, isolated environment for the agent to operate in.

The deployment architecture includes:

1. **Agent Runtime Server**: The main server that handles API requests and manages agents.
2. **MCP Servers**: Separate servers that implement the Model Context Protocol.
3. **Tool Servers**: Servers that provide access to specialized tools.
4. **Database**: A database for storing agent state and configuration.
5. **Message Queue**: A message queue for asynchronous communication between components.

## Security

Agent Runtime includes several security features:

1. **Sandboxing**: Tools are executed in a sandboxed environment to prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Access Control**: Resources and tools can be restricted based on user permissions.
3. **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for audit purposes.
4. **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
5. **Authentication**: Users must authenticate to access the system.
6. **Authorization**: Users are authorized to perform specific actions based on their roles.

## Conclusion

Agent Runtime provides a powerful, extensible framework for building autonomous software engineering agents. Its modular architecture, robust error handling, and security features make it suitable for a wide range of applications.

By leveraging the Model Context Protocol and integrating with various tools and libraries, Agent Runtime enables agents to perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention.
