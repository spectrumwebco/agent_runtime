# LangGraph and LangChain Integration

This document describes the integration between LangGraph-Go and LangChain-Go in the Agent Runtime system.

## Overview

The integration enables a multi-agent system where different specialized agents can communicate and collaborate through a graph-based execution system. The system supports four agent types:

1. **Frontend Agent**: Responsible for UI/UX development tasks
2. **App Builder Agent**: Responsible for application assembly and API design
3. **Codegen Agent**: Responsible for code generation and review
4. **Engineering Agent**: Responsible for core development tasks
5. **Orchestrator Agent**: Responsible for coordinating other agents

## Components

### LangGraph-Go

The LangGraph-Go implementation provides:

- A graph-based execution system for agent communication
- Support for different node types (agents, tasks, data, services)
- Asynchronous execution of graph nodes
- State management for nodes
- Event-based communication between nodes

### LangChain-Go

The LangChain-Go integration provides:

- Tools and agents that can be used within the LangGraph framework
- Callbacks that integrate with the event stream system
- LLM integration through model adapters
- Chain execution within graph nodes

### Integration Points

The integration between LangGraph-Go and LangChain-Go is achieved through:

1. **LangChain Bridge**: Connects LangChain components to the LangGraph system
2. **Model Adapters**: Provide a unified interface for different LLM providers
3. **Event Stream**: Enables communication between components
4. **Django Integration**: Connects the system to the Django backend

## Agent Communication

Agents can communicate through:

1. **Direct Communication**: Agents can directly call other agents
2. **Event-Based Communication**: Agents can publish events that other agents can subscribe to
3. **Tool-Based Communication**: Agents can use tools provided by other agents
4. **Graph-Based Communication**: Agents can communicate through the graph execution system

## Testing

The integration has been tested through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Tests for the integration between components
3. **Demo Program**: A simple program that demonstrates the integration

## Usage

To use the integrated system:

1. Create a multi-agent system using `CreateStandardMultiAgentSystem`
2. Add custom agents using `AddAgent` or `AddDjangoAgent`
3. Connect agents using `ConnectAgents`
4. Execute the system using `Execute`

Example:

```go
// Create event stream
eventStream := NewEventStream()

// Create multi-agent system
system, err := CreateStandardMultiAgentSystem("my-system", "My multi-agent system", eventStream)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Get orchestrator agent
orchestratorAgent, err := system.GetAgentByRole(AgentRoleOrchestrator)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Execute the system with the orchestrator agent
execution, err := system.Execute(ctx, orchestratorAgent.Config.ID, map[string]interface{}{
    "task": "Create a new UI component",
})
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

## Verification

To verify the integration:

1. Run the verification script: `./scripts/verify_langraph_integration.sh`
2. Run the demo program: `go run cmd/langraph_demo/main.go`

## Future Work

Future improvements to the integration include:

1. **More Agent Types**: Adding more specialized agent types
2. **Better Tool Integration**: Improving the integration with LangChain tools
3. **Enhanced Django Integration**: Improving the integration with the Django backend
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the performance of the system
5. **Better Error Handling**: Improving error handling and recovery
